This code was written while I was playing with the Xview2 dataset for building damage classification.
I realized most solutions were performed on png imageries, but the xbd dataset after extraction was in GeoTIFF format.
Hence this code

#How to use

NB: intall OpenCv, numpy, rasterio and its dependencies
1. provide the folder path to your imageries # tifs_path
2. privide the output path and let the code do the rest # output_path

# Viooola!
